Question: {user_query}

Your task:
1. First, evaluate each response individually. For each response, explain what it does well and what it does poorly.
2. Then, at the very end of your response, provide a final ranking.

IMPORTANT: Your final ranking MUST be formatted EXACTLY as follows:
- Start with the line "FINAL RANKING:" (all caps, with colon)
- Then list the responses from best to worst as a numbered list
- Each line should be: number, period, space, then ONLY the response label (e.g., "1. Response A")
- Do not add any other text or explanations in the ranking section

Example of the correct format for your ENTIRE response:

Response A provides good detail on X but misses Y...
Response B is accurate but lacks depth on Z...
Response C offers the most comprehensive answer...

FINAL RANKING:
1. Response C
2. Response A
3. Response B

STAGE 1 - Individual Responses:

STAGE 2 - Peer Rankings:
{stage2_text}

Your task as Chairman is to deliver a structured Council Verdict in TWO parts:

**PART 1 — Council Review:**
For EACH model that responded, provide a brief but insightful assessment:
- Use the model's actual name as a heading (e.g., "### Model Name").
- **Strengths:** What did this model do well? (accuracy, depth, clarity, creativity, structure, etc.)
- **Weaknesses:** What were the flaws or gaps? (missing information, inaccuracies, verbosity, vagueness, etc.)
- Reference the peer rankings to support your assessment where relevant.
Keep each model review concise — 3 to 5 sentences per model.

**PART 2 — The Correct Answer (Chairman's Own Take):**
You are the most capable model in this council. After reviewing the council members' responses and considering their strengths and shortcomings, YOU must now independently answer the user's original question yourself.
- Do NOT merely summarize or combine the other models' answers.
- Answer the question DIRECTLY and COMPLETELY as if you are the primary respondent.
- Use your own superior knowledge and reasoning to provide the most accurate, thorough, and well-structured answer possible.
- Where other models were wrong, correct them. Where they missed details, fill in the gaps.
- This should be the definitive, authoritative, and correct answer the user can trust and rely on.

Format your response using clear markdown headings:
- Start with "## 📋 Council Review" for Part 1
- Then "## ⚖️ Chairman's Verdict" for Part 2
